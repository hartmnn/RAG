# RAG Prompting with LlamaIndex

This project demonstrates how to apply **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) to answer questions across multiple PDF files.

Instead of relying on a single document, RAG enhances accuracy by retrieving **relevant information from multiple documents** before generating a response.

Includes sample PDF documents containing hidden numbers that are **invisible to human readers**, but extractable through code.
